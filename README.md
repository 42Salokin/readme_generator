  This is a command line application that assists the user in creating a professional README file for their projects. Using the npm Inquirer module, the user will be prompted with a series of questions relating to various sections of the README. These questions will include a title, description, installation instructions, license, and GitHub username. After all the prompts are answered, a new README.md file will be created with the inputted data displayed in the appropriate sections.
